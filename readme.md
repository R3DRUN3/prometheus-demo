# PROMETHEUS MONITORING DEMO

Prometheus monitoring demo üìä üìà üìè

## Abstract 
**Prometheus** is a free software application used for event monitoring and alerting.
<br> 
It records real-time metrics in a time series database (allowing for high dimensionality) built using a HTTP pull model, with flexible queries and real-time alerting.
<br> 
The project is written in Go and licensed under the Apache 2 License, with source code available on [GitHub](https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus) and is a graduated project of the Cloud Native Computing Foundation, along with Kubernetes and Envoy.

**Grafana** is a multi-platform open source analytics and interactive visualization web application. 
<br>
It provides charts, graphs, and alerts for the web when connected to supported data sources.
As a visualization tool, Grafana is a popular component in monitoring stacks, often used in combination with time series databases such as InfluxDB, Prometheus and Graphite.
